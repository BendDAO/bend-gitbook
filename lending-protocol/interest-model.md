# Interest Rate Model

Bendâ€™s interest rate model is calibrated to manage liquidity risk and optimize utilization. The borrow interest rates come from the Utilization Rate $$U$$.

$$U$$ is an indicator of the availability of capital in the pool. The interest rate model is used to manage liquidity risk through user incentivizes to support liquidity:

* When capital is available: lower interest rates to encourage loans.
* When capital is scarce: higher interest rates encourage repayments for the loans and additional deposits.

You can read the technical details about the interest rate model [here](../risk/interest-rate-model.md).
