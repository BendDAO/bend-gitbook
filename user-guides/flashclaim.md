# Flash Claim

Flash Claim is build on BoundNFT's Flash Loan. Through Flash Claim, you can use your NFT to claim third parties airdrop without repaying to lending pool.

For well-known airdrop projects, Bend will officially make adaptations. Users do not need to develop contract codes and understand the underlying technical details. They only need to select the airdrop project and their own NFT on the webpage to quickly complete the claim.

For those airdrop projects that have not officially supported, if you think it is good project, please give feedback in the Discord community. Bend will try to give priority to support if there is sufficient manpower and time.
