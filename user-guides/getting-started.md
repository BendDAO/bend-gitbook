# Getting Started

## Install a Web3 wallet on your devices&#x20;

Bend DAO works on the Ethereum mainnet, to interact with the site you will need a Web3 wallet. If your cryptocurrency is stored on a centralized exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance, and FTX), it does not count as a Web3 wallet, and will not work.&#x20;

### Connect your Web3 wallet&#x20;

You can easily find the “Connect wallet” button in the top right corner.&#x20;

1. Click “Connect wallet”&#x20;
2. Select a wallet you wish to connect with (MetaMask,or WalletConnect)&#x20;
3. Approve the connection from your wallet to BendDAO.xyz.&#x20;

Please double-check the URL to ensure that you are on the right domain.
