# Ownership Delegation

Through the delegation, you can use your NFT to claim third parties airdrop and verify the ownership in the discord community without repaying to the lending pool.

Ownership Delegation currently supports the [Delegate Cash](https://github.com/delegatecash/delegation-registry), more delegation protocols will be integrated in the future according to the community requirement.

For the airdrop, it depends on the target project (etc. Sewer Pass) whether support Delegate Cash or not.

For the Collab Land verification in the discord community, it depends on the target project (etc. BAYC) settings and the Collab Land integration.
