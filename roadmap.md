# Roadmap

The BendinDAO roadmap is a summary of Bend protocol development and ecosystem building, which has been organized into some seasons. Each season is centered around a set of proposals that will be discussed, voted and implemented across community governance.

While the seasons of Bend will be delivered sequentially, the work for each season happens in parallel, with research, prototyping, and development often in progress all at once across the different development streams.

The work of each season is gathered and presented in its dedicated section, representing months of effort. Here you will find an overview of the goals of the season, as well as descriptions of the core features.
