# Instant Liquidity Listing (Seller)

NFT holders/sellers can choose to instantly get up to 40% of the floor value of the listing before it even sells. The instant liquidity is actually provided by the instant NFT-backed loan. The seller is also a borrower on BendDAO with the Instant Liqudity listing.

In the first version of BendDAO marketplace only Listing an NFT for a Fixed Price is supported.

## After the deal

The buyer will pay off the loan including interests after the deal. The balance after deducting debt with interests will be transferred to the borrower (seller) after the deal.&#x20;

The amount Seller will receive = Total price - debt with interests  &#x20;

## Delisting

The seller can delist the listing anytime. But the loan will still be effective which means the accrued interest will grow making the loan health factor decrease, which might result in liquidation.&#x20;
