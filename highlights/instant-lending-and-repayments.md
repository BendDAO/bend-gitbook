## NFT Price Discovery

**NFT floor prices** are calculated using a complicated algorithm. The original price data comes from a well-known NFT marketplace which is OpenSea.

* The Bend team currently maintains the NFT price oracle.
* In the future, Bend governance mechanisms will manage the selection of sources.
