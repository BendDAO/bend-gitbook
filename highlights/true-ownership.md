# True Ownership

You wouldnâ€™t miss airdrops or potential claimables. The metadata still can be shown in your wallet.

#### What is boundNFT?

BoundNFT is an NFT which is bundling to the NFT you deposit in bend protocol. BoundNFT has the totally same metadata and token ID to the original NFT you own. So you can use boundNFT in your wallet for your social media PFP.

At the same time, Bend protocol can support NFT flash claim for boundNFT holders to claim the potential airdrop. The boundNFT is pegged to the collateralized NFT at a 1:1 ratio. So one NFT deposited will be equal to one boundNFT received. Tokens owned by boundNFT holders can be simply integrated onto NFT wallets and social media accounts.

With the above being said, we've come up with a "health factor" for when an accounts total loan is below "1" in the health factor. The user that has collateralized his NFT (boundNFT owner) will have to repay in a given timeframe in order to retrieve the collateralized NFT. In the meantime an NFT auction will be pending but will start 48 hours after the health has reached 1. If in 48 hours repayments have not been made, the auction will be activated which will give potential buyers of the NFT the possibility to repay the loan for them to then gain ownership of the NFT.

#### Flashclaim - Use your lent NFT

We've added a feature to bend where you can flash claim your NFT as long as the NFT is returned to the protocol within a block transaction. If it's not done properly the entire transaction will revert and the actions made will be effectively revoked. This is done for the security of users' NFTs.

There are no real world analogies for Flash Claim, that being said, technical knowledge is required in order to Flash Claim.

This feature will let you claim NFT rewards on other protocols while having your NFTs still in a collateral pool.
