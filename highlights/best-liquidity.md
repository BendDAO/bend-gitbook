# Best Liquidity

Based on the [instant NFT-backed loan](instant-lending-and-repayments.md), Collateral Listing becomes possible for NFT players.&#x20;

## From sellers' perspective

### Collateral Listing

With Collateral Listing, NFT holders/sellers can choose to take an instant NFT-backed loan and receive up to 40% of the floor price instantly when listing. Users can list the collateral anytime on BendDAO.&#x20;

## From buyers' perspective

### NFT Down Payment

The buyer can pay **a minimum down payment of 60%**, depending on the actual price, to buy a bluechip NFT while initiating a flash loan from AAVE to cover the remainder. The borrowed amount of the flash loan will be repaid through the instant NFT-backed loan on BendDAO.

The buyers will automatically become borrowers with the down payment. And borrowers can list their mortgaged NFT for sale as well.
