### NFT Down Payment

The buyer can pay **a minimum down payment of 60%**, depending on the actual price, to buy a bluechip NFT while initiating a flash loan from AAVE to cover the remainder. The borrowed amount of the flash loan will be repaid through the instant NFT-backed loan on BendDAO.

The buyers will automatically become borrowers with the down payment. And borrowers can list their mortgaged NFT for sale as well.
