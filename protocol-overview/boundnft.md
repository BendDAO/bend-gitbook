# boundNFT



When the borrower deposits an NFT in Bend DAO, a boundNFT will be minted as a Debt NFT. boundNFT is designed to provide the vault functionality with full security and the same digital self-expression.

boundNFT has the same metadata and token ID as the original NFT you own which means that you can use boundNFT in your wallet for your social media PFP. No one can steal your boundNFT because itâ€™s non-transferable and non-approvable.

### Utilities of boundNFT

* As debt NFTs when minted and burned on borrow and repay;
* To protect the NFT owners from hacking by [non-transferable and non-approvable](https://github.com/BoundNFT/boundnft-protocol/blob/main/contracts/protocol/BNFT.sol);
* Same metadata as PFP for [Twitter Blue](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-labs#nft);
* Get any of the airdrop, claimable & mintable assets by it;

#### [Flash claim - Use your lent NFT](../user-guides/flashclaim.md)

This feature lets boundNFT owers claim NFT rewards on other protocols while their NFTs are still used as collaterals or in the custody service.
