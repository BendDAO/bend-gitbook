# Introducing BendDAO

BendDAO is the first decentralised peer-to-pool based NFT liquidity protocol. Depositors provide ETH liquidity to the lending pool to earn interest, while borrowers are able to borrow ETH through the lending pool using NFTs as collateral instantly.

Bend protocol enables NFT assets to be pooled and converted into representing ERC721 boundNFTs to realize NFT loans.

## NFT as Collaterals to Borrow ETH

**Borrowers (NFT holders)** will bundle NFT into one separate token (boundNFT) through BendDAO Protocol in order to function as a single unit of collateral. Details of the [Collateral Ratio](risk/nft-risk-parameters.md).

Details are listed as follows:

* Initiate an instant NFT loan contract to borrow ETH from the pool
* Maintain NFT collateral ratio by repay ETH anytime
* Get back the NFT when pay off the NFT loan

## Deposit ETH to Earn Yields

**Depositors/ lenders** will be able to

* Deposit/withdraw ETH to the reserve pools
* Earn yields by providing liquidity

## From the NFT holder's point of view

#### A 48-hour liquidation protection period

In order to avoid losses caused by the market fluctuations, borrower will have a 48-hour liquidation protection period to repay the loan.

#### Same airdrop right for borrowers

Borrowers will be eligible for all related NFT holder airdrops. BendDAO will collect and distribute the airdrops to boundNFT holders when their NFTs are in the collateral pool.

Furthermore, borrowers can claim NFT rewards on other protocols while having NFTs still in a collateral pool with the Flashloan feature.

#### Never be stolen

NFTs will be converted into representing ERC721 boundNFTs through instant NFT loans. boundNFT is untransferable avoiding the risk of theft. On the other side, boundNFT has the same **digital self-expression** which can be used on Web2 social media platforms that support NFT avatar.

## From the ETH lender's point of view

#### Never goes bankrupt

The borrower's NFT collateral is locked on the platform. After the total debt exceeds the value of the collateral, the collateral is liquidated through auction, and the auction price cannot be lower than the total debt. So the lender's principal will not be lost.
