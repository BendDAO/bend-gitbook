### Phase 4. Implementation

## Emergencies

For emergencies, the BendDAO dev team has the right to go through Phase 2 directly.

BendDAO governance keeps moving forward to decentralization. Now community members can not only create BRCs and BIPs but also on-chain voting. BendDAO is in the hands of the community and veBEND holders' votes decide the future development of BendDAO.
