## Bend Launch Schedule

* [IFO (F for Fair Launch)](highlights/fair-launch.md)
* Multi-sig Election

Muti-sig Election is to form the committee to monitor the transactions and to reject the transactions that are not supposed to be executed on behalf of the Bend DAO Treasury.

* Bluechip NFT Community Voting

NFT projects with Instant NFT-backed Loan support will create a positive liquidity cycle for the project which will bring more strong price supports and long-term community development.

CryptoPunks and Bored Ape YC are the recognized blue chips which are supported as collaterals when Bend officially launches. There will be 4 more NFTs selected as the first batch of NFT collaterals with governance. Those are **Mutant Ape YC, Cool Cats, Doodles, CLONE X, Azuki, World of Women** and **CyberKongz**.

After BENDâ€™s fair launch, BEND holders can deposit BEND to get veBEND which stands for [vote-escrowed BEND](governance/vote-escrowed-bend-vebend.md).
