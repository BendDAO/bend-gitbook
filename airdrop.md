## The Utility of BEND Token

&#x20;BEND is the governance token of Bend DAO.

### Voting&#x20;

Holders of BEND can participate in voting on which NFT as collateral that Bend protocol can support for borrowing ETH and providing liquidity. It will benefit all the NFT holders as long as the supported NFT liquidity improved.

Before the mainnet launch, veBEND holders will vote for 4 of 7 bluechip NFTs that will get initial ETH lending pool support. 7 NFT collections are **Mutant Ape YC, Cool Cats, Doodles, CLONE X, Azuki, World of Women** and **CyberKongz**.

### Staking&#x20;

100% of the protocol income will be distributed to veBEND holders who stake BEND.&#x20;

## Bend Launch Schedule

* [IFO (F for Fair Launch) ](highlights/fair-launch.md)

Muti-sig Election is to form the committee to monitor the transactions and to reject the transactions that are not supposed to be executed on behalf of the Bend DAO Treasury.

* Bluechip NFT Community Voting&#x20;

NFT projects with Instant NFT-backed Loan support will create a positive liquidity cycle for the project which will bring more strong price supports and long-term community development.&#x20;

CryptoPunks and Bored Ape YC are the recognized blue chips which are supported as collaterals when Bend officially launches. There will be 4 more NFTs selected as the first batch of NFT collaterals with governance. Those are **Mutant Ape YC, Cool Cats, Doodles, CLONE X, Azuki, World of Women** and **CyberKongz**.

After BENDâ€™s fair launch, BEND holders can deposit BEND to get veBEND which stands for [vote-escrowed BEND](governance/vote-escrowed-bend-vebend.md).&#x20;
