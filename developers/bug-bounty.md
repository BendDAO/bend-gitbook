# Bug Bounty

Bend DAO [Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/benddao/) goes live on Immunefi. In addition to audit reports, Bug Bounty might be the best way to incentivize white hats to regularly search for bugs and potential vulnerabilities. The bug bounty can provide users with an additional level of security and show our long-term commitment.
