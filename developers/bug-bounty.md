# Bug Bounty

Bend DAO [Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/benddao/) goes live on Immunefi. In addition to audit reports, Bug Bounty might be the best way to incentivize white hats to regularly search for bugs and potential vulnerabilities. The bug bounty can provide users with an additional level of security and show our long-term commitment.

## Bug Bounty Distribution&#x20;

### Payout

Payouts are denominated in USD, but done in BEND.&#x20;

The BEND price in USD is calculated by **averaging prices** over a specified period of time. This period is from the **bug submission** to the **bounty distribution**.

Calculation formula:

Day Average Price = (Day High Price + Day Low Price) / 2;

Time Weight Average Price = Sum(Day Average Price) / Period;
