## What's the Difference Between WETH and ETH?

Ether, more commonly known as ETH, is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. ETH is used for things such as paying for the transaction fees on Ethereum to incentivise miners.

WETH is Wrapped Ether. WETH is an ERC-20 compatible version of ETH. 1 ETH will always be equivalent to 1 WETH. ETH on its own cannot be pre-approved (no approval) for bidding on items. That's why it needs to be wrapped.

Once ETH is wrapped into WETH, it can be used for advanced interactions on decentralized applications like BendDAO lending and exchange.
