The following are the suggested eligibility requirements.

2. The market cap is bigger than Floor Price \* 10,000;
3. The number of items is bigger than 5,000;
4. The circulation of NFTs is more than 50% of the total items;
5. The number of owners is bigger than 1,000;
6. The all-time Trading Volume on OpenSea is more than **50K ETH** (related collections Space Doodles);
7. The collection has been deployed for more than **30 days**;

**Amendments to existing requirements**

1. For an official wrapped collection, its metrics can be referred to the original collection.\
   For example, Space Doodles collection is supported as collateral, but the trading volume doesnâ€™t meet 50K ETH. Since Space Doodles are wrapped Doodles which is considered part of Doodles as well.\
