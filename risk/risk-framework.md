# Risk Framework

With billions of locked assets, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have boomed in recent years. Bend Protocol launched on the Rinkeby in January 2022, now among the top NFT lending markets for depositors and borrowers.&#x20;

The industry has been forming various standards to manage the emerging risks related to the hyper-connected ecosystem. Bend holds security at its core with audits by [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/projects/bend-dao) as detailed in [Security & Audits](security-and-audits.md).&#x20;

The following documentation analyses the fundamental risks of the protocol and describes the processes in place to mitigate them. A Bend Market Risk Assessment has been produced by the quantitative modeling team of Bend. Bend and the Safety Module have been stress tested via agent-based simulation. The simulations show that the model can remain solvent under extreme market conditions, exhibiting proper risk management. As a result, Bend provided some parameter suggestions to reduce insolvency risk further.
